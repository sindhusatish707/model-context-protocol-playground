# Model Context Protocol Playground

This repository contains my project work from completing the Introduction to Model Context Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic. The course introduced the fundamentals of MCP and provided hands-on opportunities to design, test, and apply its core concepts.

### ðŸ“˜ What I Learned

- MCP Fundamentals: Understanding how MCP servers and clients connect users to external systems, and how this differs from traditional APIs.

- Tools: How requests and results are structured and communicated within MCP.

- Resources: Usage of direct and templated resources to organize and retrieve data efficiently.

- Prompts: Defining prompts, how they interact with apps, and how users can invoke them.

- Best Practices: When to use tools, resources, or prompts depending on the problem context.

- Testing: Applied knowledge by building and testing servers with MCP Inspector.

### ðŸš€ Project Highlights

- Implemented a small MCP server with tools, resources, and prompts.

- Experimented with different request/response flows to understand communication.

- Practiced testing and debugging workflows with MCP Inspector.

### ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Python

- Model Context Protocol (MCP)

- MCP Inspector

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal

This project helped me gain a working understanding of MCP concepts, setting a strong foundation for building more advanced AI agent and tool integrations in the future.
